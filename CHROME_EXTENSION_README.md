## File Structure

## How It Works

1. **User Configuration**: Users configure their settings through the options page
2. **Secure Storage**: All sensitive data is stored locally using Chrome's storage API
3. **Direct Automation**: The content script runs directly on APEX pages to fill forms and process payments
4. **Real-time Updates**: The popup displays live status updates and logs
5. **No Server Required**: Everything happens in your browser - no backend needed!

## Security Features

- **100% Local**: All processing happens in your browser
- **No Data Transmission**: Sensitive data never leaves your browser
- **No Server Dependencies**: No external servers to trust or maintain
- **Permission Management**: Minimal required permissions for security

## Architecture

The extension consists of three main components:
- **Popup**: User interface for starting automation and viewing status
- **Content Script**: Runs on APEX pages to perform automation
- **Background Script**: Handles communication between popup and content script
